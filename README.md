# Enarx Codex

A collection of code examples that can be compiled to WebAssembly and run within Enarx.

This repository contains git submodules.
After cloning this repository, please run `git submodule update --init` to retrieve the submodules.

## Demos

The `demos` directory contains full-featured applications that demonstrate the capabilities of
WebAssembly running within Enarx.
Look here if you're interested in seeing what complete, working Enarx applications look like.

These apps are also featured on the [Try Enarx](try.enarx.dev) website, where they can be easily
launched from your browser and run within real, secured Enarx Keeps on supported cloud platforms.

Some demos have implementations in multiple programming languages.
Each demo's directory is categorized by language.

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains small, focused code examples that demonstrate how to perform
specific tasks in the context of Enarx.
Look here if you're writing an Enarx application and need guidance on how to perform a certain
task.

The examples within this directory are categorized by programming language.
Within each language's directory, you will also find instructions on how to install
and run the tools necessary to compile that language to a WebAssembly module.
